 ## Getting started guide

To get started with AstroKit, you can clone the repository from GitHub and run the following commands:

### NPM  installation

```bash 
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shawn-sandy/astro-basics.git my-blog
# Navigate to the directory
cd my-blog
# Install dependencies npm
# Install dependencies npm
npm install
# Start dev server
npm run start

```

### Yarn Installation

```bash
#  or yarn
yarn install
# Start dev server
yarn start
```

This will start a development server at `http://localhost:3000` where you can see the site in action. You can start writing your own posts by adding MDX files to the `src/content/posts` directory. The posts will automatically be generated as routes.
## Conclusion
That covers the basics of getting started with AstroKit. Have fun building your blog or documentation site! Feel free to check out the source code on GitHub and submit any issues or feature requests. Happy coding!
